Example project for a simple company information front-end website made in pure JS without any JS/CSS library or framework. Coniestica - Consolidadora internacional importación exportación y servicio de logística. Notice that Coniestica is a fictitious company.

The main background had a parallax effect (which can be 'turned on' by setting 'display: fixed' on the '.bg.parallax' element and adjusting the background-size properly) but it started to show flickering on newer versions of Chrome so I disabled the effect which is a real shame since that was one of the most important designs of the webpage. Although it is just an example project I might still incorporate that feature in v1.1.
